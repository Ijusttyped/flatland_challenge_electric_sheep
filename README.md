# Flatland Challenge

As the team Electric Sheep we participated in the [Flatland Challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/flatland-challenge) hosted by the [SBB](https://www.sbb.ch).

> The Flatland Challenge is a competition to foster progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning for
> any re-scheduling problem (RSP). The challenge addresses a real-world problem faced by many transportation
> and logistics companies around the world (such as the Swiss Federal Railways, SBB. Different tasks related to
> RSP on a simplified 2D multi-agent railway simulation must be solved. Your contribution may shape the way modern
> traffic management systems (TMS) are implemented not only in railway but also in other areas of transportation and
> logistics. This will be the first of a series of challenges related to re-scheduling and complex transportation systems.

Our team (Nien-Chun Yin, Wenjie Cai, Marcel Fernandez Rosas) achieved place 17 on the worldwide leaderboard. During the challenge we learnt to solve a problem with reinforcement learning methods. We have acquired the theoretical foundations with books, online courses and whiteboard sessions.

We successfully implemented following algorithmns:

* Q-learning
* Deep Q Networks
* Double Deep Q Networks
* Dueling Deep Q Networks
* Prioritized Experience Replay

The code can be found in this repository. Keep exploring!
